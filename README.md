This is the first project of me which is dealing with the basic concepts of the machine Learning.
This involves the following algorithms:
1. KNN
2. Decision Tree
3. SVM
4. Logistic Regression
The algorithms have been implemented on Basket ball dataset that will going to predict the chances of a team to get into final.
